# Homerooms

Homerooms are a group of 24 students in either “Rock”, “Paper”, or “Scissors”. There is a Slack channel for each homeroom. The purpose of your homeroom is to create a “classroom-sized” setting within the cohort for all students to feel seen and be able to collaborate. Homerooms remain the same throughout the cohort.
