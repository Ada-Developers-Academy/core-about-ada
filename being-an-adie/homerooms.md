# Homerooms

Homerooms are a group of 24-31 students in a “classroom-sized” setting within the cohort for all students to feel seen and able to collaborate. Homerooms remain the same throughout the cohort, and two homeroom instructors are assigned to teach each homeroom class. 

## Homeroom meetings

Homerooms will meet at their respective Zoom rooms, to be announced in Slack, the Newsletter, and respective campus Google Calendars.
