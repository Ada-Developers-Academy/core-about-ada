# Homerooms

Homerooms are a group of 24 students in either "Cedar" or "Pine" (Seattle Campus) or “Maple” or “Spruce” (Digital Campus). There is a Slack channel for each homeroom. The purpose of your homeroom is to create a “classroom-sized” setting within the cohort for all students to feel seen and be able to collaborate. Homerooms remain the same throughout the cohort.


## Homeroom Instructors

- Cedar: Jared, and Kaida with Jasmine
- Pine: Becca and Chris
- Maple: Trenisha and Claire
- Spruce: Ansel and Audrey

## Homeroom meetings

Homerooms will meet at their respective Zoom rooms, to be announced in Slack and the Newsletter.

## Logistics

Homerooms will generally meet twice a week, Mondays 1:00pm-1:30pm PST for Homeroom Check In and Fridays at 2:00pm-3:00pm PST for Retro.  Homeroom meetings will be facilitated by your homeroom instructor. These meetings are subject to change and any changes will be announced via Slack and posted on the Cohort 15 calendar.  Any additional homeroom meetings will also be posted on the Cohort 15 calendar.
