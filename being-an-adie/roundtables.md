# Roundtables

Roundtables are a core component of the Ada curriculum.  Roundtables meet almost daily and are a place to ask questions, discuss lessons and problems and review content.  The format of a roundtable includes live code sessions with instructors, group activities in the curriculum and question and answer sessions.

Roundtables are a group of 12 students, and the first roundtables will be grouped from your homeroom assignment.  Roundtables will change at the end of each unit (two times total).

Roundtables meet at either 9:30am-10:30am or 10:50-11:50am.
