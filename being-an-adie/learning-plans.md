# Learning Plans

[A Learning Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rAt2XNZskXKC2uw5RchYOvkj_ZPCCSNW_clLZl6_k5U/edit) (LP) is a structure used to help individualize the academic experience at Ada when a student would benefit from more or different support around particular curriculum content. The objective of an LP is to provide concrete and personalized solutions when you need academic support for any reason. An LP typically lasts 1-3 weeks and could resolve with no further action, or we may suggest extending/reworking the plan. 

## Here are some reasons we might suggest a Learning Plan, or why you might request one:

- You feel like you’re falling behind the curriculum and need help with pacing and prioritizing.
- There’s a particular section of the curriculum that isn’t coming naturally or you need more help understanding. 
- Some big things have been happening in your personal life and your ability to fully focus on Ada isn’t as high right now. 
- You got a red on your last assignment and we want to make sure you’re moving forward alright with that content.

## Here are some examples of what a Learning Plan might include:

- Adding in extra tutoring sessions or review sessions with an instructor.
- Identifying work to prioritize in the event that you’ve fallen behind the curriculum pace. 
- Documenting an expectation that the next project will be submitted on time even if it’s incomplete. (Helpful if you’re struggling with perfectionism.)
- Reducing the deliverables of the next project so you can focus on the most important learning goals. 

## Here are some examples of Learning Plan outcomes:

- Most frequently, the LP is helpful in addressing the core concerns and you continue with the regular curriculum. 
- Often, we may also suggest ongoing LPs to continue providing support and tailoring the curriculum and academic experience to your needs. 
- In very rare cases, after a series of many LPs and ongoing hardship in the program, we may initiate a conversation with you about whether Ada is the right place for you at this time. If this conversation is a potential outcome, it will be clearly documented in the LP from the start. The entire LP process should be collaborative and transparent enough that if we reach that conversation, we’re all in agreement about the best outcome for you.
