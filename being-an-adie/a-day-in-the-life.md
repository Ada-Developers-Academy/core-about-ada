# A Day in the Life of an Adie

No two Adies are exactly the same and neither are two Adie schedules.  We surveyed a few Adies and mashed their schedules together to come up with this rough guide to how you'll spend your day as an Adie!

## 9:00am - 9:30am

Wake up, Breakfast, Check Calendar, Slack, Email, Learn.
