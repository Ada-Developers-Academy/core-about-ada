# Assignments

Assignments at Ada come in a number of different forms, including projects, problem sets, and problem solving exercises.

## Projects

- Logistics: Projects will be assigned at various points during the curriculum.  Projects generally last a week and can be individual, pair or group projects.
- Submission: Projects are submitted through Learn and will be auto-evaluated against a set of tests when they are submitted.  
- Feedback on projects will come in two forms:
    - Your 1:1 instructor will do a code review on your submission and discuss their feedback at your next 1:1 meeting.
    - Green/Yellow/Red in Learn
        - Green
            - You have met or exceeded the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that the produced code shows enough understanding
        - Yellow
            - You approached meeting the major learning goals for this project; to the grader, there is evidence that the produced code shows some understanding, and shows evidence that not all major learning goals were met
        - Red
            - You did not meet the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that most major learning goals were not met, the progress on the project shows need for support on completion, quality, or both; the project is broken and not running

## Problem Sets

- Logistics: Problem sets are included at the end of most Learn topics and will be assigned most days throughout the majority of the curriculum. Problem sets provide an opportunity for you to spend time reviewing and checking your understanding of a topic including opportunities to both verify conceptual understanding and practical implementation. 
- Submission: Learn will automatically update your overall progress toward problem set completion as you check your answer to each question. 
- Feedback on Problem Sets will come through auto-evaluation in Learn. You will also have the opportunity to ask questions and clarify understanding with instructors and peers in class. 
   
## Problem Solving Exercises (PSEs)

- Logistics: There will be 1 PSE assigned per week throughout the majority of the curriculum. PSEs provide an opportunity for you to spend more time thinking through a problem, including clarifying specifications, determining test cases, planning your approach, and finally completing an implementation. Practicing these steps will help build a strong foundation for technical interviewing. 
- Submission: PSEs are submitted through Learn. Like problem sets, the final implementation is auto-evaluated, while other portions will receive instructor feedback through Learn comments.
- Feedback on PSEs will come in two forms:
    - Your 1:1 instructor will do a code review on your submission and discuss their feedback at your next 1:1 meeting or leave comments in Learn.
