# Assignments

Assignments at Ada come in two different forms, projects and problem sets.

## Projects

- Logistics: Projects will be assigned at various points during the curriculum.   Projects generally last a week and can be individual, pair or group projects.
- Submission: Projects are submitted through learn and will be auto-evaluated against a set of tests when they are submitted.  
- Feedback: Your 1:1 instructor will do a code review on your submission and discuss their feedback at your next 1:1 meeting.

## Problem Sets

- Logistics: Problem sets are found at the end of most topics in Learn.  Problem sets are designed to help you practice the content from the topic and are required.  
- Submission: You will work through the problem set in Learn.  They are auto-evaluated and no additional submission is required.  Problem sets are expected to be completed **two days** after the end of the topic on the calendar and will be reivewed by your 1:1 instructor at that time.
