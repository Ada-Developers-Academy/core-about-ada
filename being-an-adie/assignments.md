# Assignments

Assignments at Ada come in a number of different forms, including projects, problem sets, and problem solving exercises.

## Projects

- Logistics: Projects will be assigned at various points during the curriculum.  Projects generally last a week and can be individual, pair or group projects.
- Submission: Projects are submitted through Learn and will be auto-evaluated against a set of tests when they are submitted.  
- Feedback on projects will come in two forms:
    - Your 1:1 instructor will do a code review on your submission and discuss their feedback at your next 1:1 meeting.
    - Green/Yellow/Red in Learn
        - Green
            - You have met or exceeded the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that the produced code shows enough understanding
        - Yellow
            - You approached meeting the major learning goals for this project; to the grader, there is evidence that the produced code shows some understanding, and shows evidence that not all major learning goals were met
        - Red
            - You did not meet the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that most major learning goals were not met, the progress on the project shows need for support on completion, quality, or both; the project is broken and not running

## Problem Sets

- Logistics: There will be 1 PSE assigned per week throughout the majority of the curriculum. PSEs provide an opportunity for you to spend more time thinking through a problem, including clarifying specifications, determining test cases, planning your approach, and finally completing an implementation. Practicing these steps will help build a strong foundation for technical interviewing. 
- Submission: PSEs are submitted through Learn. Like problem sets, the final implementation is auto-evaluated, while other portions will receive instructor feedback through Learn comments.

## Problem Solving Exercises (PSE's)

- Logistics: PSE's will be assigned 1 time a week during the curriculum.  
- Submission: PSE's are submitted through Learn and will be evaluated by instructors. 
- Feedback on PSE's will come in two forms:
    - Your 1:1 instructor will do a code review on your submission and discuss their feedback at your next 1:1 meeting, or add comments to the code itself.
