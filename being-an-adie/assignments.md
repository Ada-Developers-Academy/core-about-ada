# Assignments

Assignments at Ada come in two different forms, projects and problem sets.

## Projects

- Logistics: Projects will be assigned at various points during the curriculum.   Projects generally last a week and can be individual, pair or group projects.
- Submission: Projects are submitted through Learn and will be auto-evaluated against a set of tests when they are submitted.  
- Feedback on projects will come in two forms:
    - Your 1:1 instructor will do a code review on your submission and discuss their feedback at your next 1:1 meeting.
    - Green/Yellow/Red in Learn
        - Green
            - You have met or exceeded the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that the produced code shows enough understanding
        - Yellow
            - You approached meeting the major learning goals for this project; to the grader, there is evidence that the produced code shows some understanding, and shows evidence that not all major learning goals were met
        - Red
            - You did not meet the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that most major learning goals were not met, the progress on the project shows need for support on completion, quality, or both; the project is broken and not running

## Problem Sets

- Logistics: Problem sets are found at the end of most topics in Learn.  Problem sets are designed to help you practice the content from the topic and are required.  
- Submission: You will work through the problem set in Learn.  They are auto-evaluated and no additional submission is required.  Problem sets are expected to be completed **two days** after the end of the topic on the calendar and will be reivewed by your 1:1 instructor at that time.
