# Assignments

Assignments at Ada come in a number of different forms, including projects, problem solving exercises, and problem sets. You are welcome to revisit coursework and projects, including resubmitting your work. However, in order to maintain an accurate picture of your academic journey, you will not receive updated grades if you do so. These grades are for Ada internal use only - thereâ€™s no report card that we send home or share with internship managers.

## Projects

- Logistics: Projects will be assigned at various points during the curriculum.  Projects generally last a week and can be individual, pair or group projects.
- Submission: Projects are submitted through Learn and will be auto-evaluated against a set of tests when they are submitted.  
- Feedback on projects will come in two forms:
    - Your 1:1 instructor will do a code review on your submission and discuss their feedback at your next 1:1 meeting.
    - Green/Yellow/Red in Learn
        - Green
            - You have met or exceeded the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that the produced code shows enough understanding
        - Yellow
            - You approached meeting the major learning goals for this project; to the grader, there is evidence that the produced code shows some understanding, and shows evidence that not all major learning goals were met
        - Red
            - You did not meet the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that most major learning goals were not met, the progress on the project shows need for support on completion, quality, or both; the project is broken and not running

## Problem Solving Exercises (PSE's)

- Logistics: There will be 1 PSE assigned per week throughout the majority of the curriculum. PSEs provide an opportunity for you to spend more time thinking through a problem, including clarifying specifications, determining test cases, planning your approach, and finally completing an implementation. Practicing these steps will help build a strong foundation for technical interviewing. 
- Submission: PSE's are submitted through Learn and will be evaluated by instructors. 
- Feedback on PSE's will come in two forms:
    - Your 1:1 instructor will do a code review on your submission and discuss their feedback at your next 1:1 meeting, or add comments to the code itself.
    
## Problem Sets

- Logistics: Problem Sets appear as material  in most Learn topics, usually labelled as Problem Set: Topic Name. They can vary in size, and so should be reviewed early to ensure sufficient time is allocated to work through them.
- Submission: Problem sets are completed directly in Learn. Most challenges will be auto-graded as soon as they are submitted. Problem Sets for a topic are due before the Roundtable session for that topic.
- Feedback: Feedback is generally not provided on Problem Sets. Students should expect to discuss their solutions amongst themselves for additional perspective, or bring follow-up questions to office hours.
