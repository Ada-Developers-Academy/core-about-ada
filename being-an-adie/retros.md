# Monday Homeroom Check-ins and Friday Industry Prep Sessions

"Agile" is a set of methodologies and processes of software development. In Agile, a sprint is a phase of a project. A project is completed over many sprints. Agile teams conduct daily _stand-ups_, and a _retrospective_ after each sprint. Both of them are opportunities to examine how the team is working together to complete a project or assigned work, and converse about the process by which the team is accomplishing its tasks and goals. Stand-ups and retrospective structure, design and timing vary between companies and teams in the industry.

_Side-note: We often use a different word like "iteration" instead, as "sprint" can imply moving at lightning speed all the time, which isn't a healthy long-term work environment._

We will get more into depth about Agile software development over the curriculum.

## Monday Homeroom Check-ins

Monday Homeroom Check-ins at Ada combine the Agile practices of a "stand-up" and a "retrospective" in order to achieve learning objectives of:

1. Modeling industry practices
2. Giving and receiving feedback to make adjustments to the learning process
3. Building a stronger learning community

### Monday Homeroom Check-in Meeting Flow

#### Reflections 

Spend 15 mins reflecting on the work you did for the week, then write your answers on virtual "sticky notes" (link will be provided by instructors) for any or all of the 3 categories (in columns) below:

 - What did you accomplish/learn this past week? Did you meet your goals?
 - What are your goals for this coming week? 
 - What is blocking you from achieving your goals?

#### Share out Reflections

Student volunteers to share out what they wrote on their cards (going by category/column). This may be done in breakout rooms, or the classroom.

#### Announcements and Solutions to Blockers

Announcements and a preview of the upcoming week will be made to consider how students can individually or collectively help one another unblock blockers and find solutions to challenges experienced during the learning journey. This may be student or instructor curated, depending on the classroom. Some solutions can include:

 - Student study groups
 - Office hours 
 - Tutoring
 - Other Resources and Ideas 

## Friday Industry Prep

Friday Industry Prep at Ada is a 1 hour session within core hours meant to deepen knowledge of how community engagement and critical reflection on students' own perceptions, biases, and assumptions inform their understanding of social (in)justice issues and their awareness of power, privilege, and positionality, while:

1. Preparing students to be successful in industry (algorithms, interviewing prep, using tutorials, efficient Google searches, etc)
2. Building a stronger learning community

Topics and activities will include but are not limited to:

 - Pair programming
 - Interview prep
 - Advocating for yourself 
 - Giving and receiving feedback
 - Microaggressions and affirmations
 - Dealing with uncertainty/fear moving into tech
