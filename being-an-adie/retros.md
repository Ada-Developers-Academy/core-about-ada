# Monday Homeroom Check-ins and Friday Industry Prep Sessions

"Agile" is a set of methodologies and processes of software development. In Agile, a sprint is a phase of a project. A project is completed over many sprints. Agile teams conduct daily _stand-ups_, and a _retrospective_ after each sprint. Both of them are opportunities to examine how the team is working together to complete a project or assigned work, and converse about the process by which the team is accomplishing its tasks and goals. Stand-ups and retrospective structure, design and timing vary between companies and teams in the industry.

_Side-note: We often use a different word like "iteration" instead, as "sprint" can imply moving at lightning speed all the time, which isn't a healthy long-term work environment._

We will get more into depth about Agile software development over the curriculum.

## Monday Homeroom Check-ins

Monday Homeroom Check-ins at Ada combine the Agile practices of a "stand-up" and a "retrospective" in order to achieve learning objectives of:

1. Modeling industry practices
2. Giving and receiving feedback to make adjustments to the learning process
3. Building a stronger learning community

### Monday Homeroom Check-in Meeting Flow

#### Reflections 

Spend 15 mins reflecting on the work you did for the week, then write your answers on virtual "sticky notes" (link will be provided by instructors) for any or all of the 3 categories (in columns) below:

 - What did you accomplish/learn this past week? Did you meet your goals?
 - What are your goals for this coming week? 
 - What is blocking you from achieving your goals?

#### Share out Reflections

Student volunteers to share out what they wrote on their cards (going by category/column). This may be done in breakout rooms, or the classroom.

#### Announcements/Solutions to Blockers/Calendar

Announcements and preview pertaining to the upcoming week will be made to consider how students can individually or collectively help one another unblock blockers and find solutions to challenges experienced during the learning journey. This may be student or instructor curated, depending on the classroom. Some solutions can include:

 - Student study groups
 - Office hours 
 - Tutoring
 - Other Resources and Ideas 

## Friday Industry Prep

Friday Industry Prep at Ada is meant to deepen knowedledge and competencies of social justice-related concepts, while achieving learning objectives of:

1. Modeling industry practices
2. Giving and receiving feedback 
3. Building a stronger learning community





## Facilitation

One of the most common fears people have when first trying a retrospective is that the ritual will become a negative gripe session, interspersed with blame and counter blame. Those can be cathartic, but they won't contribute to learning nor help us improve our classroom experience. We will intercept and counteract those fears with the **Retrospective Prime Directive**:

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

There will always be a facilitator during retro. At Ada, the facilitator will likely be an instructor. The facilitator's job during retro is to moderate the conversation. They will try to stop the group from getting into the weeds, and do their best to give everyone the same opportunity to be heard. Specifically, their job is to:

1. Set the Stage and introduce process
1. Gather Data -> read organized notes, provide context (if necessary),
1. Generate Insights -> lead discussion, suggest actionable items (if appropriate)
1. Decide What to Do -> Is recognition enough? Is there an action item someone gets?
1. Close the Retrospective -> Respect people's time
