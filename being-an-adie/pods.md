# Pods

We believe that peer-to-peer support at Ada is just as important as support from staff and technical volunteers. Ada Pods is a lightly-ish structured program to help you connect with other Adies in your homeroom and create community. You will be in a small group of four who will meet with each other regularly throughout your year in the program. Each pod will meet approximately every other week on their own time, with Student Services facilitating a monthly Ada Pods event.
