# Pods

We believe that peer-to-peer support at Ada is just as important as support from staff and technical volunteers. Ada Pods is a lightly structured program to help you connect with other Adies in your homeroom and create community. You will be in a small group of four who will meet with each other regularly throughout your year in the program. Each pod will meet approximately every other week, and we will provide some loose discussion questions for at least the first few meetings.
