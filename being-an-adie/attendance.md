## Classroom Attendance

In order for Ada to bring you to internship, we have a couple of hard and fast rules about attendance:

1. Cannot miss more than 15% of class.
1. There will be a Learning Plan after 5 days of excused absence or 3 days unexcused to address any concerns.
1. Three late arrivals will count as one absence.

Itâ€™s not enough to just show up! You are expected to be an active collaborator and to work with your fellow students with a positive and accepting attitude.

For in-person campuses, virtual attendance is not permitted without communicating with staff or setting up an accommodation. This ensures that we maintain the quality of education of the in-person learning experience. 

## Other Program Participation

We list that part of the requirements of the Ada program are completing:

- All required Career Services assignments
- Complete all assigned Interviews

## What's an Excused vs. Unexcused Absence?

At Ada:

- Absences that are communicated through email (see below) before core hours begin (9:30 am) are excused
- Absences that are not communicated through email before core hours begin are unexcused

You may need to communicate an excused absence for any of the following reasons:

- Appointments
- Illness/needing rest or recovery
- Life needs that you know will take you away from a computer at a certain time
- Planning to take the day off in advance
- Any other reason, really

Again, unexcused absences really are for reasons like:

- Forgetting to attend a lesson/meeting
- Deciding not to attend a lesson/meeting and not communicating it

So be sure to communicate any absences before 9:30 AM in whatever timezone you are in!

## How Late is Late?

Late arrivals are defined as being ten or more minutes late.

## How Do I Communicate an Absence or Being Late?

If you know you will be absent or late for a lesson or meeting, you **must** do one thing:

- Email absent@adadevelopersacademy.org and state your name, the day you will be absent, and a high-level reason why you will be missing class.

These emails are read by instructors, so feel free to be human!

We'll probably reply to you in case we're concerned you'll be missing a major lesson, and we'll want to make sure you're successful even if you miss a day. If possible, let us know what your Internet availability will be like and if you anticipate to be missing much work time, and how you will make that up. This is to let us get that conversation started.

## Addressing Concerns

A lot of people have a lot of different circumstances that impact attendance.

If you ever feel that you are falling behind or need extra attention, you are expected to keep your instructors and/or your student success coach in the loop.
