# One-on-one (1:1) Meetings

One of the systems of support at Ada is 1:1 meetings with a member of the Education Team once every two weeks. 1:1 are an opportunity for an instructor and student to privately discuss how the classroom environment is going, and progress towards completion of the curriculum.

1:1 meetings are a private, non-judgemental space. They are an opportunity to discuss anything from technical, to classroom, to career questions. They are also just an opportunity to get to know each other better.

1:1 instructors will provide code review on programming projects.  The 1:1 meetings will also be an space to discuss this feedback.
