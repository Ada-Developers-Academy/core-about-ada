# The Values of Ada Staff

Ada's mission and values set expectations of how we treat ourselves and one other. It's our set of principles that we fall back on when we need to make a decision of how to act in any given situation at Ada.

1. We actively work to be anti-racist, inclusive, and equitable, with a focus on the impacts of intersectional diversity. 

2. We hold a student-centered mindset and are committed to delivering a high-quality experience that appropriately challenges students.

3. We are an authentic community of learners with a growth mindset.

4. We take accountability for our work as individuals because we are part of a team that supports and can count on each other.

5. We take ownership of our work: we admit to our mistakes, take responsibility for creating solutions, and consider the impact on staff and students when we make decisions.

6. We are impact-driven. We strive to innovate and embrace change that leads to increasing the impact of our work.

We encourage you to support us keeping these values close, keeping us accountable, and also **sharing these values with us**.
