# Work in Progress

**Hello C16!**

We, the Education Team at Ada, would like to give a personal letter to you, C15. We are hoping to share some feelings of excitement and curiosity.
What do you all think about the program so far?

C15 marks the beginning of something really special at Ada. C15, you are the first class to work with Ada's new curriculum, named Core Curriculum!

Our previous curriculum, named Textbook Curriculum, has served Ada from its beginning all the way through C14, at the end of 2020. We've learned so much with the Textbook Curriculum, from how to structure units, to what kind of fun topics bring life into our world. The Textbook Curriculum proved to us that iterative change is doable and vital to our program, as it helps us respond to each other in real-time. However, the Textbook Curriculum had a few weaknesses. The Textbook Curriculum has evolved and grown into a beautiful beast, but it's time to move forward.

The Core Curriculum is based on everything we've learned from the last seven years. This new curriculum was restructured and rebuilt. We hope this new curriculum

- Focuses the content and the material you need to be successful in this career
- Balances and refreshes the content, with a more updated understanding of the industry and other CS education practices
- Aligns with how our Ada community, students and instructors alike, actually operate!

All of this work was done thoughtfully, with the only goal to make the student and instructor experience better and more successful.

That being said, the Core Curriculum being used in the classroom will provide a lot of interesting and fun surprises. We'll be transparent: We anticipate some bumpiness.

We anticipate:

- Parts of the curriculum feeling less clear than intended
- Parts of process that feel less clear than intended

We, the Education Team, are nervous because we will not make the best decisions all the time, and we will need to collaborate, reflect, and evolve with you this year. We see this new curriculum as an opportunity to grow our communication more openly, honestly, and optimistically, always driving towards everyone's success.

As the Ada staff work towards making the best learning experience yet, we ask that you keep an open mind. Things may be a little different than what you've heard from past cohorts. With an open mind, you'll see that we are still Ada Developers Academy through-and-through. Above all, we ask that you, C15, give us support, patience, grace, understanding, and loving and critical feedback as we work through the road bumps.

We're in this together! Let's stay in this together, and have a fun time, too,

-- Education Team, March 2021
