# Work in Progress

__NOTE: This is an updated version of the C14 letter, replace if desired.__

**Hello C15!**

We also wanted to give a personal letter to you, from the Education Team at Ada! We were hoping to share some feelings about uncertainty, and ask for grace from you all.

What do you all think about the program so far?

While we've now run two very successful cohorts online, the first, C13,spent 18 weeks learning online and C14 was completely online.

We are sad and anxious, as this online experience may not be what you expected for learning programming, and it will be very different from how you experienced school, education, or learning in the past.

We're nervous because we _will_ not make the best decisions all the time, and we will need to collaborate, reflect, and evolve with you this year.

However, learning programming in an online format is genuinely one of the best and most exciting things we can imagine. Not only are we living in the future, but we are _forming_ the future.

As the Ada staff work towards making the best learning experience yet, we ask that you, C15, give us support, patience, grace, understanding, and loving and critical feedback as we work through the road bumps.

We're in this together! Let's stay in this together, and make it good and great together, too.
