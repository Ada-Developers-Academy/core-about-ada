# Welcome

Dear Ada Student,
 
Welcome to Ada Developers Academy!
 
We are thrilled that you are participating in our innovative training program designed to help gifted, confident, and dedicated people become software developers in under a year.
 
The next year will be filled with an incredible amount of learning. Be prepared to be excited, confused, frustrated, challenged, and enlightened â€“ maybe all in the same day! The staff are dedicated to make this the best experience it can be for you and your classmates, but that also means we rely on you to bring your best self every day to class and to your internship.
 
Ada is thrilled to have you join a program that we believe can be truly transformational for you, for our partner companies, and eventually, for our region as a whole. We're not just another code school, we're a tuition-free program dedicated to changing the diversity in tech, one amazing grad at a time. 
 
Kudos to you for taking the leap towards an amazing new career!
 
Regards,
The Ada Team
