# Zoom

At Ada we use Zoom for audio/video communication. Zoom is a video conferencing and screen sharing tool.  You will need to sign up for a free Zoom account at [zoom.us/signup](https://zoom.us/signup).  You can download the Zoom Client for Meetings at [zoom.us/download#client_4meeting](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting) or the client will download automatically the first time you attempt to join a Zoom meeting.  

To join a Zoom meeting type the meeting URL into the browser, and the Zoom client will launch and join the meeting.  Some meeting rooms at Ada can be joined automatically and some are set up with a "waiting room" feature.  If you are joining a meeting and are placed in the waiting room you need to wait until the owner of the meeting admits you into the meeting.

## Recording

At Ada we often record meetings such as roundtables to allow students to review discussions at a later date.  If a Zoom meeting is being recorded you will be notified by Zoom that you are being recorded.
