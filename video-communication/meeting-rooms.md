# Online Meeting Rooms

For C15, Ada is using Zoom for online classes and meetings. We maintain a set of permanent links to "classroom" zoom meetings.

## Recordings

When the online meetings are recorded we have enabled the recordings to automatically import into Panopto, our video storage and streaming service.

You can find the recordings here:

## Instructor Private Rooms

Instructors also have private zoom meeting links to their personal accounts they can share with students for 1-on-1s. These rooms are not open except by appointment for private discussions.  They typically can be found with instructor-first-name.adadev.org
