# Audio/Video Communication Norms

1. **Have your video camera on** as much as possible
   - This allows for attentive engagement, body language, and shared sense of belonging
1. Update your [Zoom profile settings](https://us02web.zoom.us/profile) so that **your name conforms to this template and includes your pronouns: `Name (pronouns)`**
   - For example, Simon's Zoom name is `Simon (they/them)`, Becca's is `Becca (she/they)`, Chris's is `Chris (he/him)`
   - Some other pronoun examples include `Ada (any pronouns)`, `Ada (ze/hir)`, `Ada (ask me)`, `Ada (use my name)`
1. **Use the Chat feature** for on-topic conversation and questions
   - This is our best way to hear your questions!
1. **Keep yourself on mute until you're ready to speak**
   - This eliminates audio feedback and distraction
1. **Set your Zoom avatar to be an image that represents your appearance (so we can recognize you!)**
   - Consider a photo of yourself or a cartoon avatar that resembles you.

### Tips

- Use the Reactions feature of Zoom!
- You can enable remote access through Zoom-- a feature that will let someone else on the Zoom call control your computer temporarily. Sometimes we will do this at Ada!
- Tools you can use to generate a cartoon avatar:
  - [Bitmoji](https://www.bitmoji.com/)
  - [Picrew](https://picrew.me/) (Site is in Japanese, but buttons are decently clear)

## Take Care Of Yourself

We understand that navigating the waters of appearing on camera is tricky. Also at the same time, we as a staff can guarantee that there where will be days where we do not look our best and we may be wearing pajamas. In the same way that we ask you to not judge us, we commit to the best of our ability to not judge our community like that. Above all, the Ada community is an inclusive space, whether that's digital or in person.

That being said, there are plenty of reasons why some of these video-call norms may not work for you. You may need to abbreviate or obscure your name and/or pronouns or turn off your camera for plenty of reasons, such as:

- Being in an environment sensitive to cameras
- Being somewhere with a strangers or folks who cannot be photographed
- Being somewhere where your name/pronouns should not be visible in this context
- Being somewhere where your background isn't appropriate to share on camera
- Being somewhere temporarily noisy or busy or visually distracting, such as construction, traffic, events, etc.
- Needing privacy in this context
- Having limited Internet bandwidth/access
- You have reasons why you do not have access to a web camera, or use a web camera
- ...Or any other situation where you would need your camera off or names/pronouns hidden

<br>

The goal of our norms is to create consistency, strengthen our bonds with each other, and help with our communication, engagement, and learning. There are many ways we can achieve this in case some of these norms don't work for you.

<br>

If you'd ever like to talk to Ada staff about these norms, _**all**_ Ada staff (education team and beyond) is open and excited to hear from you. We welcome all communication and conversation about these norms at any time; reach out in person, through email (staff emails in Student Handbook), or on Slack!
