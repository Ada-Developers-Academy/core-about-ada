## Calendar Norms

This is our source of truth for itinerary per day. **The exception is if we make a more immediate adjustment that is communicated via Slack.**

Every event has a title, length/duration, and event details.

The event details will contain important links, resources, details, etc. **Event details will often include the links to the Zoom call you need to join at that time.**

Here are some events that you will see frequently on your calendar:

- **Checklist**: Daily 8am-9am event. The event details contain everything we expect/hope that you accomplish before the following day. The checklist has two sections:
    - Daily Tasks: This includes things like lessons and problem sets
    - Ongoing Tasks: This includes things like projects
- **Roundtables**: Roundtables meet daily in the mornings within core hours
- **Group Activities**: Events that indicate a specific group of students meeting. We will communicate group activity assignments through Slack and Email, so check those.
