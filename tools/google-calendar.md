# Google Calendar

At Ada we use [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_bjceit17n8akmnlv3chul3r5s4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) to schedule lessons, meetings and homework.

Staff and TA office hours will be posted on the [Ada TA Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19zYnYwbTZqNGZ0Mmt2aTN1dHBlbWpoMGVoZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)

## Calendar Norms

This is our source of truth for itinerary per day. **The exception is if we make a more immediate adjustment that is communicated via Slack.**

Every event has a title, length/duration, and event details.

The event details will contain important links, resources, details, etc. **Event details will often include the links to the Zoom call you need to join at that time.**

Here are some events that you will see frequently on your calendar:

- **Checklist**: Daily 8am-9am event. The event details contain everything we expect/hope that you accomplish before the following day. The checklist has two sections:
    - Daily Tasks: This includes things like lessons and problem sets
    - Ongoing Tasks: This includes things like projects
- **Roundtables**: Roundtables meet daily in the mornings within core hours
- **Group Activities**: Events that indicate a specific group of students meeting. We will communicate group activity assignments through Slack and Email, so check those.
