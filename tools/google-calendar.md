# Google Calendar

At Ada we use Google calendar to schedule lessons, meetings and homework. Please find the your respective campus calendars on your campus website.

## Calendar Norms

This is our source of truth for itinerary per day. **The exception is if we make a more immediate adjustment that is communicated via Slack.**

Every event has a title, length/duration, and event details.

The event details will contain important links, resources, details, etc. **Event details will often include the links to the Zoom call you need to join at that time.**

Here are some events that you will see frequently on your calendar:

- **Checklist**: This denotes what is expected due as per your campus
- **Roundtables**: Roundtables meet mostly daily in the mornings and afternoons within core hours
- **Group Activities**: Events that indicate a specific group of students meeting. We will communicate group activity assignments through Slack, Email, and the Newsletter, so check those.
