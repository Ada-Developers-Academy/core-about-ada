# Classroom Activities - Seattle

At Ada, we use a variety of tools to communicate. This means that resources for classroom activities can live on different platforms.

Resources relevant to class activities will be documented weekly in [the linked google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fc3uxnhtb9QMIvc2PsAIl56LtNlGf4trfNBBZuejQek/edit?usp=sharing).
