# Email

## Email Norms

Often times we'll email out important information. Please check your email at least once a day.

## Classroom Newsletter

During the classroom portion of Ada a weekly newsletter will be sent out every Monday morning. Please email your student support coach for more information on whether you would like to include content in an upcoming newsletter.

## Internship Newsletter

Once you transition to the internship portion of Ada, you will no longer receive the classroom newsletter and will instead recieve a newsletter from the Internship and Career Services Team every other week.

## Staff Email Addresses

Staff email addresses are in the Student Handbook.
