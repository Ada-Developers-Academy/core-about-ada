# Email

## Email Norms

Often times we'll email out important information. Please check your email at least once a day.

## Classroom Newsletter

During the classroom portion of Ada a weekly newsletter will be sent out every Monday morning.  Each week a slack message about the newsletter will be posted in the general channel on Wednesday to allow students to add information and the newsletter is finalized on Friday.

## Internship Newsletter

Once you transition to the internship portion of Ada, you will no longer receive the classroom newsletter and will instead recieve a newsletter from the intership coordinator every other week.

## Staff Email Addresses

Staff email addresses are in the Student Handbook.
